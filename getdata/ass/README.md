This folder contains the run_analysis.R file required to produce the clean dataset for the course project for 'Getting and Cleaning Data' - March 2015.

Running the script:
- Ensure your working directory contains the UCI HAR dataset
- in R:
- source(run_analysis.R)
- run_analysis()

This will produce a file 'output.txt' containing the clean and tidy dataset.
